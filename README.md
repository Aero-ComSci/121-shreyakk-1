picks a random number within the default window range to be the x position and the y position of the turtle - sets the position of said turtles to the variables. Also picks a random shape size. function is called whenever the turtle is clicked upon the onclick- meaning it transforms each time.

called when onclick event occurs, runs by using the values onclick releases- an x and y value. finds the timer and timer_up values from the set up at the start and uses that to verify whether or not the function should continue allowing for updated scores or should hide the turtle. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b1761c3-4433-454f-a43c-584113d47655)
